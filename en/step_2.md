Open a new Scratch project.

**Online:** open a new online Scratch project at [rpf.io/scratchon](http://rpf.io/scratchon).

**Offline:** open a new project in the offline editor.

If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](http://rpf.io/scratchoff).

Give your program a name by typing one into the text box in the top left-hand corner.

Then click on **File**, and then on **Save now** to save your project.

If you don't have a Scratch account, you can save a copy of your project by clicking on **Download to your computer** instead.
