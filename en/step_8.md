## Challenge: improve your band

Use what you've learnt in this project to make your own band! You can create any instruments you like â€” look at the available instrument sprites and sounds to get some ideas.

Your instruments don't have to be realistic though. For example, you could make a piano made out of muffins!

As well as using sprites from the library, you can also draw your own.

title: Why is my sprite 'jumping' when it changes costume?
---

When creating your own sprite, you may find that when you click the sprite, it 'jumps' as it changes costume. This is because the two costumes aren't centered in the same place.

To fix this, click on **Set costume center** for both costumes, and make sure the center is at the same point in both of them.

If you have a microphone, you can record your own sounds, and you can even use a webcam to hit your instruments!
